.. _testing:

======================
Tests for Page Objects
======================

``web-poet`` provides :ref:`tools for testing page objects
<web-poet:web-poet-testing>`. ``scrapy-poet`` projects can use a Scrapy command
to easily generate tests::

    scrapy savefixture my_project.pages.MyItemPage 'https://quotes.toscrape.com/page/1/'

This will request the provided page, create an instance of the provided page
object for this page, request its :meth:`~web_poet.pages.ItemPage.to_item`
method and save both the page object dependencies and the resulting item as a
test fixture. These fixtures can then be used with the ``pytest`` plugin
provided by ``web-poet``.

Configuring the test location
=============================

The ``SCRAPY_POET_TESTS_DIR`` setting specifies where to create the tests. It
can be set in the project settings or with the ``-s`` command argument.

Handling time fields
====================

The tests generated by ``savefixture`` set the :ref:`frozen_time metadata value
<web-poet:web-poet-testing-frozen_time>` to the time of the test creation.

.. _fixture-spiders:

Using spiders
=============

By default ``savefixture`` creates a simple spider that uses the project
settings and makes one request to the URL provided to the command. It may be
needed instead to use a real spider from the project, for example because of
its :attr:`~scrapy.Spider.custom_settings`. In this case you can pass the
spider name as the third argument::

    scrapy savefixture my_project.pages.MyItemPage 'https://quotes.toscrape.com/page/1/' toscrape_listing

The command will try to run the spider overriding its
:meth:`~scrapy.Spider.start_requests`, so it should run just one request but it
can break on spiders with complicated logic, e.g. ones that use ``spider_idle``
to schedule requests or modify items returned from
:meth:`~web_poet.pages.ItemPage.to_item`. You may need to adapt your spiders to
this, for example checking if the special ``_SCRAPY_POET_SAVEFIXTURE`` setting
is set to ``True`` and using more simple logic in this case.

.. _fixture-adapter:

Configuring the item adapter
============================

As documented in :ref:`web-poet:web-poet-testing-adapters`, fixtures can use custom
item adapters. ``savefixture`` will use the adapter specified in the
``SCRAPY_POET_TESTS_ADAPTER`` setting when saving the fixture.

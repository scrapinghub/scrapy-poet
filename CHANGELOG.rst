* Use the new ``web_poet.HttpResponse`` which replaces ``web_poet.ResponseData``.
* We have these **backward incompatible** changes since the
  ``web_poet.OverrideRule`` follow a different structure:

    * Deprecated ``PerDomainOverridesRegistry`` in lieu of the newer
      ``OverridesRegistry`` which provides a wide variety of features
      for better URL matching.
    * This resuls in a newer format in the ``SCRAPY_POET_OVERRIDES`` setting.
* Removal of this deprecated module: ``scrapy.utils.reqser``

------------------

0.0.2 (2020-04-28)
------------------

The repository is renamed to ``scrapy-poet``, and split into two:

* ``web-poet`` (https://github.com/scrapinghub/web-poet) contains
  definitions and code useful for writing Page Objects for web
  data extraction - it is not tied to Scrapy;
* ``scrapy-poet`` (this package) provides Scrapy integration for such
  Page Objects.

API of the library changed in a backwards incompatible way;
see README and examples.

New features:

* ``DummyResponse`` annotation allows to skip downloading of scrapy Response.
* ``callback_for`` works for Scrapy disk queues if it is used to create
  a spider method (but not in its inline form)
* Page objects may require page objects as dependencies; dependencies are
  resolved recursively and built as needed.
* InjectionMiddleware supports ``async def`` and asyncio providers.
